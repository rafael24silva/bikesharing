## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. For this purpose, we have created a bike-sharing analysis using Tableau. The data was taken from Citi Bike for the month of August. With this data, we were able to create many different visualizations that answer different questions.
## Results
The following images display the results of the analysis:

## Summary
From what the data has given, the majority of our consumers opt-in by subscribing. Considering how the data was taken from a high-traffic city, such as New York. We can infer that many of these consumers use these bikes to commute to and from work. This is why peak-hours are from 5pm to 6pm. The vast majority of consumers are men. The average time people rent bikes are between 4 and 6 minutes. This information could be used to find a way to appropriately distribute bike stations in terms of location and distance. Two additional visualizations that could help us see a bigger picture are the most popular end locations on a map and also a graph that shows the average life of a bike. These can help with distribution of bike stations and will also help with maintenance and replacement costs.
